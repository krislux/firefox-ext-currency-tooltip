# Currency Tooltip Extension

Simple Firefox extension that converts prices in $ or â‚¬ on any website to DKK.
Made for personal use, and is not currently very configurable. Changing the target currency requires changing the code.

Currently hard locked to exchangerate-api.com for currency rates.

Prices denoted with `$` will be assumed to be USD. Does not currently respond to e.g. AUD or CAD suffixes.

## Usage

Get a free API key from [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
Paste the API key in the options page of the extension.
Go to any website with prices in $ or $.
